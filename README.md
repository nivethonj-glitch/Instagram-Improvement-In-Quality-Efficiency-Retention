# Instagram-Improvement-In-Quality-Efficiency-Retention
## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive **Ecosystem Health Check** on Instagram user engagement and retention. Instead of relying on surface-level metrics like "Time Spent," we engineered **Engagement Quality Efficiency (EQE)** — a custom metric that measures meaningful value delivered vs. fatigue from passive consumption and monetization pressure.  

Using predictive **Churn Risk Scoring** and behavioral segmentation, the analysis reveals a critical paradox:  
**Efficient Engagers** (users achieving the **highest EQE** with low effort and low creation) face the **highest average churn risk** — not due to burnout or ad overload, but likely insufficient social validation, growth feedback, and emotional reward.

## Key Findings
- Global EQE (1.707) masks deep imbalances — highest churn risk concentrated in **Efficient Engagers**
- L-Curve in EQE vs Total Activity confirms diminishing returns: high volume shifts to passive consumption
- Platform is "top-sided" — most users act as passive consumers rather than active, reciprocal nodes
- Lifestyle factors show almost no correlation with churn (except moderate negative link with stress)
- Age and geography are weak predictors compared to behavioral drivers

## Tech Stack & Methodology
- **Data Engineering**: Python (pandas, custom behavioral archetyping, churn risk scoring)
- **Visualization & Interactivity**: Tableau (primary + secondary dashboards, guided filters)
- **Core Metrics Engineered**: EQE, Churn Risk Score, Ad Fatigue, behavioral segments (Efficient Engager, Passive Scroller, etc.)

## Interactive Dashboards

## Actionable Recommendations
- **Protect Efficient Engagers** — amplify creator reach, lower posting friction, reward small outputs
- **Reduce subtle dissatisfaction** — test notification/ad caps for high-EQE users
- **Shift from volume to reciprocity** — nudge passive users toward light creation
